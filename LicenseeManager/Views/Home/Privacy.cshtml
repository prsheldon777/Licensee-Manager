<h1>Privacy & Data Usage</h1>

<p class="text-muted">
    This application is a demonstration system for managing licensees, offices, and audit history.
    It is intended for evaluation and training purposes only and is not a production application.
</p>

<h3>What data does this application handle?</h3>
<p>
    The application is designed to work with the following types of data:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Licensee information</strong> – names, email addresses, license numbers, license types, status, and expiration dates.</li>
    <li><strong>Office information</strong> – office names, locations, and identifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Audit log entries</strong> – records of changes to licensee status for traceability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How is the data used?</h3>
<p>
    All data displayed in this application is used solely to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations,</li>
    <li>Show how licensee and office relationships can be managed,</li>
    <li>Illustrate audit logging of status changes and record updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In a real environment, this type of data would typically be limited to authorized staff and used only
    to support internal business operations and regulatory compliance.
</p>

<h3>Demo data and test environment</h3>
<p>
    The data used in this instance of the application is sample or test data only.
    It is not intended to represent real individuals or real organizations, and it should not be treated as
    production or customer data.
</p>

<h3>Access and security</h3>
<p>
    This project is intended to run in a local or controlled development environment.
    Access to the application and its database is limited to the person or team evaluating the code.
    No external authentication, encryption, or production-grade security controls have been enabled,
    as the focus of this project is on demonstrating architecture, data modeling, and application features.
</p>

<h3>Your responsibilities if reused</h3>
<p>
    If this application or its code is adapted for real-world use, it is the responsibility of the deploying
    organization to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Implement appropriate authentication and authorization,</li>
    <li>Secure database access and connections,</li>
    <li>Comply with all applicable privacy, security, and data protection regulations,</li>
    <li>Provide users with clear and accurate privacy and data-handling information.</li>
</ul>
