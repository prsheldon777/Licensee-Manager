      "1. Describe file purpose: central JSON configuration consumed by Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration in Program.cs.",
      "2. Explain 'ConnectionStrings' section: contains 'DefaultConnection' used by AppDbContext via builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString(\"DefaultConnection\").",
      "3. Recommend secrets handling: advise NOT to store production credentials in this file; use User Secrets, environment variables, or a secret store (e.g., Azure Key Vault).",
      "4. Explain 'Logging' section: controls logging providers/levels. Note common adjustments for development vs production (e.g., Microsoft.* at Warning).",
      "5. Explain 'AllowedHosts': controls which host names are considered valid for requests when host filtering is enabled.",
      "6. Provide guidance for overrides: use environment-specific files (appsettings.Development.json) or environment variables to override values securely.",
      "7. End with example notes showing where the application reads values (Program.cs registers DbContext using DefaultConnection)."
    ],
    "ConnectionStrings": "The 'DefaultConnection' string is used by EF Core in Program.cs when registering AppDbContext. Use localdb for development; switch to a managed SQL Server instance for production and store credentials securely.",
    "ConnectionStrings_SecurityNote": "Do not keep production credentials here. Prefer User Secrets for local development, environment variables for CI/CD, or a secret manager (e.g., Azure Key Vault) for production.",
    "Logging": "Configure minimum log levels here. 'Default' controls the app-wide level; provider-specific keys (like 'Microsoft.AspNetCore') can be raised to reduce noise from framework logs.",
    "AllowedHosts": "Restrict to explicit hostnames in production (e.g., 'example.com'). Using '*' is acceptable for local development but not recommended for production."
